Notes:

You guys did an EXCELLENT job on this assignment.  I like the way you have
the "expected" and "got" messages to tell the user what each operational
step does.  You have the one required test for noDups(), but from now on,
consider writing more tests to insure that your code works for things like
error conditions, empty arrays, and so on.

GREAT work using sets and arrays to make your lives easier!

you got 27 out of 25 which is 108% which is an A-plus
