
Homework03 Evaluation
======================
You MUST do problem 1, the "odd-even sort"

You MUST do EITHER problem 2, Huffman, OR problem 3, Simon.  
Whichever one you choose is your option, but you must indicate 
which one you choose.  If you want to do both of them, you will 
be given extra credit for whatever points you get correct on 
the second problem.  For example, if you choose to do Simon and 
it is completely correct, and you do Huffman for extra credit 
and get 5 out of 7 correct, you will get 136% for the assignment.
The extra points will be applied at the end of the semester to 
improve your overall score for the course.

Assuming odd-even sort is correct, of course....
