
Homework03 Evaluation
======================
You MUST do problem 1, the "odd-even sort"

You MUST do EITHER problem 2, Huffman, OR problem 3, Simon.  
Whichever one you choose is your option, but you must indicate 
which one you choose.  If you want to do both of them, you will 
be given extra credit for whatever points you get correct on 
the second problem.  For example, if you choose to do Simon and 
it is completely correct, and you do Huffman for extra credit 
and get 5 out of 7 correct, you will get 136% for the assignment.
The extra points will be applied at the end of the semester to 
improve your overall score for the course.

Assuming odd-even sort is correct, of course....
=============================


Nice work on this assignment!
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Looks like you changed a function name in Bubble Sort but didn't 
change all the tests--so
be careful! Good thorough tests. 
Really nice job on Huffman!

Simon doesn't erase the computer-generated letters so the user can
still see the sequence.  Also doesn't present "play again" message
on error input.  Otherwise, nice work!

Total credit is 14 for Sorter and either Simon or Huffman
 extra credit is 7 points for other of Simon or Huffman
-------------------------
 Grand total is 21 points for all three

you got 17 out of 14 which is 121.43% which is an A-plus
