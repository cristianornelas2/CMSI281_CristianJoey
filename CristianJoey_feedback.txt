score breakdown:
==================================================================
                                    possible       you got
HighArray.java class evaluation     --------       --------
   coding style                     [3 pts.]        3 pts. [4 pts. if EC]
      1 pt consistent indents			    X 0 pts.
      1 pt good variable names			    ✓
      1 pt commenting			            ✓
      1 pt extra credit file header		    ✓
   getMax() method exists           [1 pt.]         1 pt.
   noDups() method exists           [1 pt.]         1 pt.
   file compiles                    [1 pt.]         1 pt.

HighArrayApp.java class evaluation
   coding style                     [3 pts.]        4 pts.  [4 pts. if EC]
      1 pt consistent indents			    ✓
      1 pt good variable names			    ✓
      1 pt commenting				    ✓
      1 pt extra credit file header		    ✓
   file compiles                    [1 pt.]         1 pt.
   min 5 new tests for getMax()     [5 pts.]        4 pts.
   test[s] for noDups()             [5 pts.]        5 pts.

Results of running of the program
   program runs, passes all tests   [5 pts.]        5 pts.

Notes:
Some methods in HighArray lacking indentation, missing a test for noDups, I like your approaches to getMax and noDups!

you got 25 out of 25 which is 100% which is an A-plus
